Prepocessing:
1. Stop words: remove all the words those match with the words in the stop words file provided.
2. Lemming/Stemming
3.	Emoji: Some reviews contain emojis (e.g :), :(, ...) that could be important in determining whether that review is positive, negative, or neutral. First, parse through the data to find all the emojis. Then we replace the emojis into words that represent them according to the emoji.xlsx file. After that, based on the word that represent the emoji's meaning, we convert them into emojiScore. For example: happy is +3, winky is +2, skeptical is +1, indecision is 0, sad is -2, angry is -3. After converting the emoji into emojiScore, we calculate the total score for each review that contains emoji in their review.
4. User Ratings:
	Many users give ratings by using these formats: # stars, # out of #, # of #, #/#.
	We separate them into two parts, one is with the number ratings (e.g 5/10, 4 out of 5, etc) and another one is with the star ratings. Some people put multiple ratigns for individual parts, so it gets the average of all the ratings.
5. Positive and Negative words:
	We found 2 dataset contains positive and negative words that are commonly used in reviews.
	We match all the positive and negative words in each review with the two dataset. Then we count the total number of positive and negative words.
