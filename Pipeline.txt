Goal: Find important features of the review text

Create clean, similarly organized data: translate all parts into single format
Look at patterns of the test data set and find reoccurring features:

    1. Emojis: convert to text with emoji.csv
        - ✔ find which emojis are even found in the test file: some are not found
        - redo the .csv file to good and bad
    - remove quotes (high priority, after checking for emojis since some use quotes)

    2. Number Star Review: convert "4 stars", 'three stars' into a separate class: distinguishable
        i.e. 4 stars != very good; 4 stars = 'review=4' or 4stars (but this would be special case during the # removable phase)
        issue:
            - ✔ 3 5 stars -> change to 3.5 stars
            - ✔ 10/10 change to 10
            - added the # and 'stars' to stop words (or else double counted).
            i.e remove instances of 3.5, 'star', 'stars' just for that review
    3. keep ! and ? next word but in the same order and only ?!: i.e. MATTER!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!! -> MATTER?!
        or separate ! and ? and keep all of them
        - count number of ! and ?

    4. (maybe not) keep capitals (unless training data doesnt have as much)
    - find number of all capitalized words

    5. Not implemented: Misspelt word count?
    - keep misspellings and then count number of words that are misspelt then change them into real words
    - 'aaaaaaa' -> a
    - 'Goood' -> good
    - 'OMGGGGG' -> OMG
    - 'sooooo' -> so

    6.Count number of positive words and neg words in each review. 
        - match pos and neg words from each review w given neg and pos words dataset.
