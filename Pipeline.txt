Goal: Find important features of the review text

Create clean, similarly organized data: translate all parts into single format
Look at patterns of the test data set and find reoccurring features:

    1. Emojis: convert to text with emoji.csv
        - find which emojis are even found in the test file: some are not found
        - redo the .csv file to good and bad

    2. Number Star Review: convert "4 stars", 'three stars' into a separate class: distinguishable
        i.e. 4 stars != very good; 4 stars = 'review=4' or 4stars (but this would be special case during the # removable phase)
        issue:
            - 3 5 stars -> change to 3.5 stars
            - 10/10 change to 10
    3. keep ! and ? next word but in the same order and only ?!: i.e. MATTER!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!! -> MATTER?!
        or separate ! and ? and keep all of them

    4. (maybe not) keep capitals (unless training data doesnt have as much)


    - 'aaaaaaa' -> a
    - 'Goood' -> good
    - 'OMGGGGG' -> OMG
    - 'sooooo' -> so


    - remove quotes (high priority, after checking for emojis since some use quotes)
