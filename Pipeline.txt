Goal: Find important features of the review text

1. Create clean, similarly organized data: translate all parts into single format
    1. Look at patterns of the test data set and find reoccurring features:
        - Emojis: convert to text with emoji.csv
            - find which emojis are even found in the test file: some are not found
        - Number Star Review: convert "4 stars", 'three stars' into a separate class: distinguishable
            i.e. 4 stars != very good; 4 stars = 'review=4' or 4stars (but this would be special case during the # removable phase)
        - keep ! and ? next word but in the same order and only ?!: i.e. MATTER!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!! -> MATTER?!
            or separate ! and ? and keep all of them
        - keep capitals (unless training data doesnt have as much)
        - 'aaaaaaa' -> a
        - 'Goood' -> good
        - 'OMGGGGG' -> OMG
        - 'sooooo' -> so
        - remove quotes (high priority, after checking for emojis since some use quotes)
